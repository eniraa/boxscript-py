# BoxScript

![logo](./logo.png)

BoxScript, or BS for short, is a language based on the idea of "boxes".

What are boxes, exactly? Boxes, and their younger sibling, blocks, are simply units of code. They can be loops, conditionals, or anything else, really. Expressions with different purposes go into different blocks, and blocks with different functions go into different boxes.

In other words, this is a language which encourages ***thinking inside the box*** when writing code—literally, since no code can exist outside of a box. And, if you ask me, that's part of the charm of this language—BS!
